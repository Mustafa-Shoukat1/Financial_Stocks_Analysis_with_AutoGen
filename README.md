# 📈 Stock YTD Gain Analysis

This project offers an automated solution for generating and visualizing Year-to-Date (YTD) stock gains for specific stocks. Using Python, it retrieves stock data, calculates percentage changes, and creates informative visualizations of stock performance over time.

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Stock Data Retrieval**: Seamlessly fetch stock prices using the `yfinance` library.
- **Customizable Date Range**: Easily analyze stock performance over any period by adjusting the date range.
- **📊 Visualization**: Generate clear and insightful plots to display YTD stock gains.
- **User-Defined Functions**: Includes modular and reusable functions for fetching stock data and plotting the results, making it easy to extend the analysis.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Task Initiation
A task is initiated to analyze and report on Nvidia's stock performance over the past month.

### Planning
The Planner identifies the essential data needed: historical stock prices, market context, and relevant news events. The Planner also suggests steps for retrieving this information using Python.

### Code Development
The Engineer writes Python code to fetch Nvidia's historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance.

### Execution
The Executor runs the code to obtain the stock data.

### Writing
The Writer drafts a blog post based on the retrieved stock data, focusing on key movements, volume surges, and potential influencing factors.

### Feedback Loop
The Admin (User Proxy) reviews the draft, providing feedback to refine and finalize the blog post.
